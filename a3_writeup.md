# Assignment 3 - Writeup

Assignment 3 is all about creating this natural language query system.  In order to do so, you have to write a lot of functions to retrieve infomation.  You will also have to write a function to return answers from a pattern-action list.  There is a lot of work to accomplish in this assignment, but this portion is intended for you to write about what you accomplished.

## Reflection Questions
1. In your own words describe the `search_pa_list` function.
It basically matches the "user input" with the expected prompts, and pulls all the necessary information in order to find and show the user what they are looking for.

2. What movie did you add to the `movies.py` file?  What year was it made? Any specific reason you added that movie?
I added the Barbie movie, made in 2023 just because :)

3. What pattern / action did you add to the paList data structure?  Why do you think that is a useful pattern / action?
I added the "_ was in what movie?" pattern to the data structure, because some people think in different orders and rather than confuse the chatbot, you can just show it different sentence structures and it will understand the same question in different set ups.

4. What is chatbot would you create that would be like this?  Describe why you would create it and what it would do.
I would create a chatbot that could tell you about flowers? Something like "what flowers are currently in season?", "What color are _ flowers?" etc. because I like flowers and gardening, and I think being able to have access to a chatbot that can tell me about flowers quickly would be very helpful rather than having to search for hours on the internet just to find a very vague answer. Or weather, it would be cool to ask a chatbot the weather from 2 weeks ago, even if you dont need it, but it might be easier than flowers?

5. What was the most difficult portion of this assignment?
I think the most difficult portion was the first "action" as in title_before_year, etc. because it was the first one, and figuring out what to do for that one took me a second because I had to figure out what each line of code did for the action, but every action after that came easy because it used the same skeleton.

6. Did you write a new assert for your pattern action?
yes.
